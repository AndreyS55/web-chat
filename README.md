# Web chat

This is an anonymous web chat. Messages are anonymous, but each member's messages are colored uniquely. The color of the messages is saved after tab reload.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` from home directory to run both client and server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `npm run start:client` or `npm run start:server` from home directory to run client and server separately.
